## Setup

### For Users (Publishing Posts)

Users who want to use this action need to:

1. **Get Dev.to API Key**
   - Go to https://dev.to/settings/extensions
   - Generate API Key

2. **Add to Repository Secrets**
   - Go to your repository Settings → Secrets → Actions
   - Add secret: `DEVTO_API_KEY`

3. **Use in Workflow**
   ```yaml
   - uses: Walsen/hugo-to-devto-action@v1
     with:
       api-key: ${{ secrets.DEVTO_API_KEY }}
       file-path: 'content/en/posts/my-post.md'
   ```

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### For Developers (This Repository)

Developers working on this action don't need a Dev.to API key unless testing. See [API_KEY_SETUP.md](docs/API_KEY_SETUP.md) for details.

## Development

### Building the Action

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript code and bundle it with dependencies into `dist/index.js`.

### Testing Locally

You can test the core functionality using the original script:

```bash
export DEVTO_API_KEY="your-api-key"
npx tsx scripts/publish-to-devto.ts path/to/your/post.md
```
